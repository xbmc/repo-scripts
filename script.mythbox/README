History
==========================
MythBox was forked from xbmc-mythtv (http://xbmc-mythtv.sourceforge.net) 
and largely rewritten to bring MythTV protocol support up to date, 
add new features, and make MythTV a pleasure to use in XBMC.
Many thanks to all the developers whose time and effort went into the original 
xbmc-mythtv project!
