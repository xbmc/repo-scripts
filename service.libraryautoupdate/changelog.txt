Version 0.6.2

- needed a catch in case the last_run.txt file is blank, or has non-integer data. thanks to mmounirou for catching this

Version 0.6.1

- added 2 more custom library path options

Version 0.6.0

- added "Cleaning" category to schedule a clean operation of the music/video databases. This operation can happen immediately after a scan or once per day/week/month. Verifying source paths before a clean is also supported

Version 0.5.9

- added a custom video path option to only scan a specific video path instead of the entire library

Version 0.5.8

- added a 1 minute delay timer before running a scan if XBMC has just exited playback. This should help in scenerios where ending media viewing results in an immediate scan that the user didn't want. 

Version 0.5.7

- merged 'standard' and 'advanced' usage to follow more of the same codebase. Now the standard timer uses a cron expression as well and will start at the top of every hour

Version 0.5.6

Version 0.5.0

-major changes to settings, split them by General and Timer category
-Advanced timer functions now add the ability to do cron-like scheduling of the update process, thanks to pkscuot for the timer ideas
-option to skip during media playback or run the update anyway

Version 0.4.1

-added extra setting for a "startup delay" timer. This will only affect the addon when xbmc starts. 
-the last running time is now set to a variable so that manual updates will reset the timer, and system resets will start the service where it left off

Version 0.4.0

- Had a user suggestion to allow for a manual launch of the process as well as the service. Since the service point will ALWAYS launch on startup the manual option will kick off the library update process. 

Version 0.3.9
 
- running video and music scans side by side never really worked. Now checks if scan is running and waits until complete before running the next scan. 

Version 0.3.5

- removed sample autoexec.py
