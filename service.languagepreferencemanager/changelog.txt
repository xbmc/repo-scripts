--- Version 1.0.3

- Improve 10sec subs latency workaround: new option to disable it (default), or enable it at 'start only' or 'start+resume'.
   (fast multiple resumes could sometimes generate video restart or long freeze due to large audio/video desynch)
- Option to prioritize 'SignsSongs' tracks via custom conditional sub preferences. Syntax is ...>Eng:Eng-ss>...
   (Overrides general 'Ignore Signs and Songs toggle' or 'Blacklisting Signs via keyword', if ever used)
- New Keywords Blacklist for Audio tracks. Same principle as for Subtitles, based on track name, to skip some (ex. Commentary, ...)
- Fix Greek and Serbian language codes according to Iso639-2/T. Fix some typos.
- Fix support of multiple 3 digit codes per language (ex. German ger,deu). Now OK also for Conditional Subtitles preferences.

--- Version 1.0.2

- Fix 10sec latency on subs display and possible few lines lost - at video start or when switching audio.
- Forced sub tracks : check also subtitle field "isforced" in case field "name" is empty or misspelled.

--- Version 1.0.1

- Initial version for main Kodi.tv addons repository

--- Version 1.0.0

- Mandatory clean-up to propose as candidate version for Kodi.tv addons repository.

--- Version 0.1.7BETA

- New Keywords Blacklist to ignore chosen subtitles tracks based on name content.

--- Version 0.1.6

- Fix custom conditional preferences rules not working. (note : if ...>lan:non>... is used then forced tag is assumed on. See v0.1.3)
- Add a switch to completely ignore 'Signs and Songs' types of subtitle tracks. Default is off.
- Add special 'Any' audio language code to allow easy / simplified Conditional Subtitles rules like 'pol:non>any:pol'.
- Plus some small typo fixed.

--- Version 0.1.5

- Fix preferences rules numbering in log messages.
- Skip extra genre/tag JSON video query when no custom prefs used at all.

--- Version 0.1.4BETA

- Conditional subtitle logic improvement. Rules are re-evaluated and applied on-the-fly if audio track is changed during the playback.

--- Version 0.1.3

- Conditional subtitle logic adjustement : if "Lang1:None and forced tag set" then disable subtitles
              but only if no Lang1 forced subtitle is found. Otherwise we activate this one.
	      
--- Version 0.1.2

- Adding an icon.png
- Fixing settings.xml CustomAudio, Sub and CondSub : allowempty=true to avoid multiple errors in the kodi log when not used.

--- Version 0.1.0

- Fixing conditional subtitles like "French:None" not working. Not detected and then subtitles were not disabled.
  (if sub_code is none) is the test to return -1 in default.py... But column 3 of None in langcodes.py is "non" as a string.
  So I just changed the test in line 268 accordingly, and all is fine now.

--- Version 0.0.7 + Matrix + Python3 + Languages fixed + more Languages fixed

- Fix compatibility with matrix and Python3
- Fix languages codes in string.po not aligned with KODI language codes (ex. French etc...)

- Fix compatibility with jarvis and krypton

--- Version 0.0.5

- Added support for multiple 3 digit codes per language (thanks to waven!)

--- Version 0.0.4

- Added a language called "None". If set as a conditinal subtitle language
	subtitles get disabled if the audio language matches.

- Added support for per genre/tag custom preferences. Syntax is 
	tag/genre1,tag/genre2...#(custom pref; see below)|tag/genre3,tag/genre4...#(custom pref; see below)
	If no genre/tag# part is provided the pref gets evaluated for any genre/tag

--- Version 0.0.3

- Custom preferences. Syntax is lang1>lang2>lang3>... for audio and sub 
							and lang1:lang2>lang3:lang4>... for cond. subs
- Wanilton's Portuguese (Brazil) translation, thanks!
- schumi2004's Dutch translation, thanks!
