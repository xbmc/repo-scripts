In the next screen, select the line from your original subtitle which matches the first.\n\nSubsequently, you'll be asked again to select a line from your reference subtitle and to match this with the same line in your original subtitle. Usually the best choice is the last spoken line from the video. After this your two subtitles will sync!\n\nCheck 'Scroll subtitles' to view them and 'Save subtitles' to write them to a file."

When your first subtitle is not the first line from the video, select 'Delete' until the first subtitle is also the first line from the video. \n\nThen finetune the position of the video, possibly by using the 'Skip forward 1 second' or 'Skip backward 1 second' buttons. If the position is perfect, choose 'Select as start'. \nNow fast forward to the end of the video, and repeat the same process. \n\nAfter this, your file will be synced to the video."
