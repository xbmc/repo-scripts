# Overrides.xml

The overrides.xml file is used by many of the advanced functions of Skin Shortcuts to define how they will behave, and what they will show. See individual topics in [Advanced Usage](./Advanced%20Usage.md) for details of the specific elements that each function uses.

The overrides.xml file needs to be in a shortcuts folder in your skins directory. All content goes within an `<overrides />` element.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<overrides>
	<!-- All elements here -->
</overrides>
```
