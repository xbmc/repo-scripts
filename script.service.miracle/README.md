# Kodi and Alexa integration

This addon is intended to pair your Kodi with Alexa-enabled services such as Amazon Echo.

## Installation

- Install the Miracle Alexa Addon from the Kodi repositories
- Go to the addon's configuration page and click "Pair"
- Follow on-screen instructions

## General Addon Comments

The addon uses an always-on, encrypted connection to a server which forwards requests from the paired Alexa. In addition, all communication is only one-way (incoming into Kodi) so no sensitive user data is leaving the device. 

To reduce stress on server resources, most processing is done in the addon itself. This allows the community to overview the implementation and suggest improvements.

Feel free to fork this repository, make changes and suggest them as improvements via pull requests.
