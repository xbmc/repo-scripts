    <description lang="en_GB">
        Runs as a service and will periodically update the resume point while videos are playing, so you can re-start from where you were in the event of a crash.  It can also automatically resume a video if Kodi was shutdown while playing it. See setting to configure how often the resume point is set, and whether to automatically resume.
