A1. Please file a defect if the issue has not already been identified @
    http://code.google.com/p/mythbox/issues/list

    Creating a new defect:
    
    1. Grab the MythBox log file:
       - Linux  : ~/mythbox.log
       - Mac    : ~/Library/Logs/mythbox.log
       - Windows: Log file broken at the moment.

Q8. (Linux Only) Why does XBMC act like I pressed a button twice on my remote
    control when I only pressed it once?

A8. Known issue with XBMC - See http://trac.xbmc.org/ticket/4552 
    (add your $.02 to the Trac ticket if you would like to see this fixed)
    The workaround is to add <remoterepeat>700</remoterepeat> to your 
    advancedsettings.xml. (A higher number for the delay may be required)
    
    More info on this issue be found here:  
    http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=Advancedsettings.xml#.3Cremoterepeat.3E

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9. Where is the source code?  
    
A9. To checkout the source (assuming you have Mercurial installed): 
  
        hg clone http://mythbox.googlecode.com/hg MythBox
  
    Description of source tree:
    
        +-bin        - packaging scripts
        +-resources
            +-src    - source code
            +-test   - unit tests
            +-lib    - 3rd party libs
            +-skins  - default skin xml files + images
                
    To run unit tests from the MythBox dir:
    
        $ source bin/setenv; python2.4 resources/test/runtests.py                

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
Q10. When are you going to add feature <insert your feature here> to MythBox?  
     
A10. If I find the feature compelling enough, there is reasonable chance that
     it might make its way into the codebase. If you're technically inclined,
     feel free to submit a patch. High quality patches are always welcome! 
     Otherwise, create an enhancement request on Google Code's issue tracker
     so that the feature can be tracked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
Q11. What sort of MythTV setup do you use with MythBox? My setup doesn't seem
     to work.

     It is quite possible that you may be having problems getting MythBox to work
     if your setup is significantly different from mine.

     FrontEnd + Slave Backend (Zotac HD-U11 - Atom 1.8Ghz - NVidia ION2 - 2GB)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q12. When I play a recorded program, I get nothing but a green screen.

     You need to change your recording profile to use MPEG4 instead of RTjpeg.
     1. Start the MythTV frontend
     2. Go to Utilites/Setup->Setup->TV Settings->Recording Profiles->Software Encoders->Live TV
     3. Set the codec to MPEG4 instead of RTjpeg.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
Q13. How do I fix a 'MySQL connection error 1043 bad handshake' error?

     Your MySQL database server is set to authenticate using the old MySQL 4.0 style 
     instead of the newer style used since MySQL 4.1+. This is pretty easy to fix 
     if you have phpMyAdmin installed (highly recommended). Just login to phpMyAdmin
     using your mythtv username and password and then click on the password link to
     reset it making sure you select MySQL 4.1+ for 'Password hashing'.
     
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
Q14. How do I fix a 'Connect to MySQL failed: Found EOF after Auth' error?

     1. Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and change old_passwords=1 to old_passwords=0
     2. Reset the password for the MythTV database (see Q14) and restart MythBox

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
Q15. What is the difference between XBMC's myth:// protocol support and MythBox?     
     
     Feature                  MythBox        XBMC + myth://

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
Q16. What is the plan to support the new Confluence skin released in XBMC 9.11?
     
     While I've been able to cobble together the current look & feel of the
     MythBox user interface based on the PM3.HD skin, I am by no means aesthetically 
     gifted. If you've got the skills or think you're up to it, please get in touch 
     and lets get you commit access.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q17. How do I run the unit tests in MythBox's debug shell?

     1. You have to be running MythBox directly as a clone of the hg repo, not as 
        an installed addon:
            $ cd ~/.xbmc/addons 
            $ mv script.mythbox script.mythbox.installed
            $ ln -s <dir where your mythbox hg repo is cloned> script.mythbox   
     
     2. Edit bootstrapper.py and add your hostname to bootstrapDebugShell()
     3. Start up XBMC and launch MythBox
     4. In a shell:      
            $ telnet localhost 9999  (user/pw = mb/mb)
              import unittest2
              unittest2.TestProgram(
                    module='mythboxtest.mythtv.test_domain', 
                    defaultTest='JobTest', 
                    exit=False, 
                    verbosity=2)

     Test output shows up in mythbox.log
