-6.0.15 (2015-12-04)
- Fix unicode normalization issue where some search strings could become an empty string.
- Fix a crash in the DST date code for certain funky dates.
- Use commas in addon.xml's provider-name value.
- Updated language files from Transifex

-6.0.14 (2015-03-14)
- Change some posx values for right aligned text.
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.13 (2014-11-26)
- Another fix to avoid an error on really old years (e.g. 0193).
- Use the "Ended" message instead of "Cancelled/Ended".
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.12 (2014-09-01)
- Added additional runtime-override matching.
- Removed the properties deprecated in 6.0.8.

-6.0.11 (2014-07-27)
- When fixing up missing artwork, we now also make use of thetvdb paths in the show data.
- Added advanced options ExtraShows and OmitShows to the settings.
- Some more tweaks to the adjunct data-viewing script, cal-server.
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.10 (2014-05-02)
- Tweak service handling to avoid running the service on anything prior to 12.3.

-6.0.9 (2014-05-01)
- Reverted to 6.0.7 due to Frodo bug (12.0 failed, 12.3 was fine).

-6.0.8 (2014-04-30)
- Fixed a bug where the Yesterday list would omit any shows that didn't also have upcoming episodes.
- Added the ability to override a show's "runtime" (in minutes) on per-show basis by including a string like "(30 minutes)" in the episode's comments on TheTVDB (e.g. a music show's result-show is usually shorter than the default runtime).
- Fixed a bug that could cause an erroneous tuple value in the saved data if a show's time changes w/o any episode changes.
- Improved the show-searching logic a bit more.
- Support new "backend=-N N" command-arg to allow a skin to request more ListItem querying ("backend=True" is the same as "backend=0 0").
- Added an xbmc.service that starts on login.  This supersedes the call that we've asked skins to run to start up the background update process.
- Use a single next.aired.db file to hold all the different profile's shows.  This reduces duplicate scanning and downloading of the same info when switching profiles.
- Fix a crash issue with the "nice dates" when the long-date string contains unicode characters.
- Due to a potential conflict in property names, the *-TVGuide2.xml day-name properties (NextAired.Today, NextAired.Yesterday, NextAired.Tomorrow) are now deprecated.  Use NextAired.TodayText, NextAired.YesterdayText, NextAired.TomorrowText instead.
- To avoid any backend conflict with the property "NextAired.Today", there is now a property of "NextAired.AirsToday" that a skin should query going forward (the older value will still be supported for quite some time, but the newer value is safer).
- Added an adjunct python script that can be used to view the next-aired data more fully: it starts up a web server on port 9999 and can output a variety of day lengths, profile combos, etc.
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.7 (2014-03-25)
- The zoneinfo tar file should now be back in the release zip (the new version in 6.0.5 apparently caused it to vanish from the release process).
- A couple more update improvements (including improvements for really large collections).

-6.0.6 (2014-03-24)
- Fix a couple timezone issues that could cause the script to exit, including yet another bug in dateutil.
- Fix an off-by-one error in the DB-upgrade code that could sometimes cause a failure.
- Make the backend processing capable of bringing in updated data.
- Tweak am/pm time format a bit.

-6.0.5 (2014-03-22)
- Added a new today-week TV Guide xml file and lots of new skinning values.  The new guide can also show yesterday's episodes, if desired.
- Add a means for the user to request new info for a single show.
- Restored the population of the Classification info.
- Improved DST timezone support and computation of Airtime between timezones, including better handling of Airtime changes.
- Improved the episode search when we're trying to find the show's website ID.  This includes multi-language searching and better handling of utf-8 characters.
- Improve a month-period update: work around some (unexpectedly) missing episode-change data in the month-update file.
- If the interactive update stops fetching data due to failures, mention it to the user in an "OK" dialog.
- Added the "updateshow=TVShowTitle" option to re-grab the current data for a single show.
- Make the background process auto-start a replacement if it notices a version change.
- Don't put so much data into the debug log by default.  Lots of other logging tweaks.
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.4 (2014-03-05)
- A few more tweaks to the missing-artwork grabber.
- Improve error handling when refreshing the country.db file.
- Updated language files from Transifex.

-6.0.3 (2014-03-02)
- Fix a potential script crash with a background query not triggering a DB update (if it is needed).
- Make the new date format a setting boolean.
- Help the user find missing artwork for their list-item icons.
- A few more minor improvements to the error-handling logic.

-6.0.2 (2014-02-28)
- Fix timezone crash on systems that can't handle a date prior to the unix epoch in the tz computations.
- Supply an image for a list-item entry in the Guide that would otherwise be a blank selection area.
- Improve the auto-stopping of the background-update proc when the addon updates.
- Localize the day names in AirTime and change " at " to a colon (": ").
- Fix the day-name computation in AirTime for shows that have no episodes in the upcoming week.

v6.0.1 (2014-02-25):
- The first wider release of 6.0.x (after limited-release testing of 6.0.0).

v6.0.0 (2014-02-12):
- This version of Next Aired grabs its data from TheTVDB.com.  This provides quicker updates and more upcoming-episode information.
- The GUI now includes separate episode info for each show that appears multiple times in the upcoming week. If a show is broadcast multiple times on a particular day, it will be listed multiple times on that day.
- The settings have changed to specify how often (in hours) background updates occur (the default is every 8 hours).  There is also a setting for how old the data can be before interacting with the TV Guide will cause an update (also set to 8 hours).
- The data presented to the user and to the skins is mostly the same, with a few minor differences.  For instance, the Classification field is now always empty (no such data available), the Status field has a more limited sete of possible values, and the NextDate and LatestDate fields have a tweaked date format.
- Lots of bug fixes, performance improvements, and improved error handling.
