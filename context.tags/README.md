# kodi.context.tags

here is an addon that will put a new item under the manage context menu for movies and tvshows. 

my motivation was to separate our massive movie & tv collections into 4 sections, for the wife, kid, me, and  the whole family. the current system is far too cumbersome. i built this for me, but perhaps others might like it too. 

# WARNING - Use At Your Own Risk
i take no responsibility for anything that happens. if your cat has babies, if your plants become sentient or if your library gets borked. i might be able to help, but i can't promise. the best thing to do is always make a backup. 

# what it does
- pulls a list of tags currently in the db
- compares that with those of the item currently selected
- presents a multi-select box to modify the selection
- saves your selections back into the DB

# TODO
suggestions are welcome, pull requests preferred. it does exactly what i want it to
- perhaps add the ability to create new tags ?

# Download and install
- grab the [zip file](https://github.com/zosky/kodi.context.tags/archive/master.zip)
- install in kodi ( settings > addons > install from zip )
