Kodi Addon: RandomTV

I searched for an addon to play Random TV Episodes from my library and while I found a few, none were really what I wanted. So what's a guy to do? Write his own addon of course. :D

I'm a little anal when it comes to watched status and stuff in my library with the "in progress" icon, so one of my biggest requirements was to be able to not update the Play Count or resume info. So basically, I wanted an addon that would set the playcount and resume info back to what it was before playing.

There are a couple options in the setting menu:
- Include Unwatched
- Update Play Count
- Repeat Playlist
- Shuffle On Repeat
- Show Notifications
- Enable Auto Stop
  - Auto Stop Timer (Minutes)
  - Time To Wait For Response (Minutes)
- Include All TV Shows or Select certain TV Shows

It seems to be working pretty well for me on a couple different Pi's running OSMC and on my Windows UWP installs, so I figured I would release it to see of others could benefit.

Comments/feedback/bug reports welcome, but be gentle, it's my first ever addon.  ;-)
