# script.embuary.info

Script to provide skinners the option to call The Movie DB for actor and video infos.
Unlike ExtendedInfo it requires a skin integration and it does not include a browser and it only crawls for the most basic and required information.

## Search by string

Some examples
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=person,query='"Bruce Willis"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,query='"Californication"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"',year=2008)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"',year=2008,exact=true)```

`'" "'` is not required, but useful if a string contains special characters. which needs to be escaped.

*Multiple results*
The script provides a selection dialog if multiple results were returned.

## Search by The Movie DB, IMBDb or TVDb ID

*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=person,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,tmbd_id=65,season=1)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,external_id=70559)``` (ID must be TVDb or IMDb)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,dbid=1)``` (fetches TVDb from uniqueid table in the database if available; title + year is used as fallback)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,external_id=tt0371746)``` (IMDb ID)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,dbid=1)``` (fetches IMDb ID from uniqueid table in the database if available; title + year is used as fallback)

## Options

* An TMDb API key is already shipped but can be replaced in the add-on settings
* To get support for Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb ratings it's required to add a own OMDb key in the settings
* EN is used as default language. It can be changed in the add-on settings, but will still be used if important informations are missing from the result (The Movie DB doesn't have a own fallback logic).
* US is used as default country locale for certifications. Other supported locales can be set in the add-on settings.

## Required windows, reserved IDs and properties
*Important*
* I hate it if a script takes control about the focus. Because of that it's up to the skinner to add a `<defaultcontrol>` tag.
* `ListItem.DBID` is filled if the found item is part of the local library.
* All actions on the control IDs below are controlled by the script.
* The script doesn't set any window property for the called item. You have to call it from the main container. Examples: `$INFO[Container(10051).ListItem.Directors]`, `$INFO[Container(10051).ListItem.Rating]`, `$INFO[Container(10051).ListItem.Art(thumb)]`

## Overwriting onback or provide an additional onclose action
You can add a custom onback or a general onclose action in script-embuary-video.xml and script-embuary-person.xml

*Example*

* `<onload>SetProperty(onclose,SetFocus(100))</onload>` = To set a general action if a window is going to be closed. Like reseting the focus to a default control.
* `<onload>SetProperty(onback_10052,SetFocus(900))</onload>` = Don't close the window, but set focus to ID 900 if onback was called while container 10052 was in focus.
