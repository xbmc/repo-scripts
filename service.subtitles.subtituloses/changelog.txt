0.0.7
- Addon marked as broken

0.0.6
- Changed host to http://tusubtitulo.com
- Added section 'series' to the main_url
- Fixed an issue that generated the tvshow name with blank spaces at the end when tvshow not listed/indexed in Library, making the normalizer that replaces blanks per dots generate a wrong search string.
- Changed the regex that gets the download links
- Todo:
	- The url endpoint needs a tvshow_id: {tvshow}/{season}/{episode}/{id}... but doesn't process it at all, for now I pass directly a string to comply with the signature.

0.0.5- Addon now maintained by m0r3 due to one year without fixing bugs
     - Updated addon.xml
     - Fixed an issue that prevent the plugin for working if tvshow is not listed properly in library.
Now the plugin will detect this situation and parse filename to get the proper values. Suported formats are: S01e10 110 1x10
