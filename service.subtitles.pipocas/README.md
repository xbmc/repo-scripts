service.subtitles.pipocas
=========================

Pipocas.tv subtitle service plugin for XBMC 13 Gotham or newer.
Ported from the Frodo version.

NOTE: There is a Kodi Bug at 18.x and 19.x you should be aware: If you've a .zip or .7z file in the same folder of your video you want to open, you'll have many problems. Kodi will seem to crash randomly. But it crashes only when acessing (scanning) the media library. For example, when clicking to "Browse subtitles" or when you stop a video, etc... Everytime kodi tries to scan the media library it will crash IF you've a .zip or .7z on the same folder as the video you've opened. BUT this only happens if you've libarchive installed (Archive Support Addon). This addon doesn't cause any issue, since it enables in realtime the libarchive (Archive Support) to extract and disable it right after so it can work flawlessly.
