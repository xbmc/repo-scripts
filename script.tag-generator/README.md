Tag generator helps you create Smart Playlists from IMDb/Trakt Watchlists by tagging local movies found in specified lists.
Also creates a stand-up comedy tag based on Wikipedia comedians, as there is no genre for stand-up.
Specify your IMDb/Trakt watchlists then choose the desired Kodi tag for each list.
Runs as a service in the background at a specified interval, and also allows for manual creation.
For Trakt, you can add lists from your own account, from public accounts, or shared lists from anyone you are friends with (people you follow, who follow you back).
Oscar tagging lets you tag winners and/or nominees with each award for each movie in the following format 'Winner: Best Motion Picture'.

Download as a zip then install via the Kodi interface.
