# script.embuary.info

Script to provide skinners the option to call The Movie DB for actor and video infos.
Unlike ExtendedInfo it requires a skin integration and it does not include a browser and it only crawls for the most basic and required information.

It also includes a lightweight alternative to `script.tv.show.next.aired` based on Trakt.tv plus the TVDb.

## Search by string

Some examples
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=person,query='"Bruce Willis"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,query='"Californication"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"')```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"',year=2008)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,query='"Iron Man"',year=2008,exact=true)```

`'" "'` is not required, but useful if a string contains special characters. which needs to be escaped.

*Multiple results*
The script provides a selection dialog if multiple results were returned.

## Search by The Movie DB, IMBDb or TVDb ID

*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=person,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,tmbd_id=65,season=1)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,external_id=70559)``` (ID must be TVDb or IMDb)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=tv,dbid=1)``` (fetches TVDb from uniqueid table in the database if available; title + year is used as fallback)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,tmbd_id=65)```
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,external_id=tt0371746)``` (IMDb ID)
*  ```RunScript(script.embuary.info,call=movie,dbid=1)``` (fetches IMDb ID from uniqueid table in the database if available; title + year is used as fallback)

## Options

* An TMDb API key is already shipped but can be replaced in the add-on settings
* To get support for Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb ratings it's required to add a own OMDb key in the settings
* EN is used as default language. It can be changed in the add-on settings, but will still be used if important informations are missing from the result (The Movie DB doesn't have a own fallback logic).
* US is used as default country locale for certifications. Other supported locales can be set in the add-on settings.

## Required windows, reserved IDs and properties
