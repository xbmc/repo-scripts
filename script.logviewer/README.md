This project is a continuation of the work previously done by [fightnight](https://github.com/fightnight).
It consists of a script add-on to easily check and analyse Kodi's log file. Some features are described bellow:
- Dedicated API such as script methods (```xbmc.executebuiltin("RunScript(script.logviewer, show_log)")```)
- Service for monitoring errors
- Full screen window for showing the entire log
- If possible, allows to invoke "Kodi Logfile Uploader" for uploading the log

More info can be found in Kodi's [forum](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=223490).
