# addon.black.bars.never
An addon to automatically remove black bars in KODI

It effectively eliminates the problem of black bars. If the black bars are hardcoded, the addon will automatically 
		detect this and remove them. If the video is a wide screen format, the addon will also detect this and zoom as necessary, filling the screen
		
For Android, detection of hardcoded black bars is not working currently, we are working to resolve this. All other platforms like Linux, Windows and Apple OS family everything should work correctly
		
Tested on KODI 19.4
