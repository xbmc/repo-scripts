## History

This addon is based on previous work by m0r3 and inifinicode on the original Subtitulos.es addon and its first port to TuSubtitulo.com
If you are a bit lost let me explain:
Subtitulos.es was a very well known site where users could translate series subtitles from english to Spanish collectively. It worked incredibly well and was useful for many people and one of the main sources for spanish subtitles sometimes taking even less than 24 hours to release a translation. All that ended (or so we thought) when the Spanish authorities threatened the owner of the page and, out of an abundance of caution, he decided to close the page.
Soon after that closure TuSubtitulo.com appeared on the radar holding all assets of Subtitulos.es such as the design and the actual files and continued with the 'legacy'
The only downside being that the new administrators didn't believe in access from outside the page and made it very hard to scrape the content (notice very hard does not mean imposible).
Fast forward to now, the previus supporters have stopped giving updates and I'm taking responsibiity of this addon.


## Installation

You can either download it from the releases page of this repository or look for it in the official kodi repository from within kodi itself.
Note: since they have to manually accept updates it is possible that this one is, at times, more updated than the other one


## Features

- Detection of incomplete subtitles (and consecuent discarding)
- Scrapping every version
- I could continue but right now it is very basic


## Bugs

- None so far


## TODO

- Add rating support, TuSubtitulo doesn't offer ratings but I'll figure something out
- Specify version in subtitle name, the capability is there so this one is pretty easy
-


## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to any project, one of the best ones is to report bugs, the best practice for doing so is to attach a logfile (http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy) and explain clearly under which circumstances the error was produced.
Another way is to submit a pull request, they are very welcome since currently I'm alone so feel free to take on a bug by yourself or add any functionality you deem necesary.
