=====
ijson
=====

Ijson is an iterative JSON parser with a standard Python iterator interface.


Usage
=====

All usage example will be using a JSON document describing geographical
objects::

    {
      "earth": {
        "europe": [
          {"name": "Paris", "type": "city", "info": { ... }},
          {"name": "Thames", "type": "river", "info": { ... }},
          // ...
        ],
        "america": [
          {"name": "Texas", "type": "state", "info": { ... }},
          // ...
        ]
      }
    }

Most common usage is having ijson yield native Python objects out of a JSON
stream located under a prefix. Here's how to process all European cities::

    import ijson

    f = urlopen('http://.../')
    objects = ijson.items(f, 'earth.europe.item')
    cities = (o for o in objects if o['type'] == 'city')
    for city in cities:
        do_something_with(city)

For how to build a prefix see the Prefix section below.

Sometimes when dealing with a particularly large JSON payload it may worth to
not even construct individual Python objects and react on individual events
immediately producing some result::

    import ijson

    parser = ijson.parse(urlopen('http://.../'))
    stream.write('<geo>')
    for prefix, event, value in parser:
        if (prefix, event) == ('earth', 'map_key'):
            stream.write('<%s>' % value)
            continent = value
        elif prefix.endswith('.name'):
            stream.write('<object name="%s"/>' % value)
        elif (prefix, event) == ('earth.%s' % continent, 'end_map'):
            stream.write('</%s>' % continent)
    stream.write('</geo>')


Events
======

When using the lower-level ``ijson.parse`` function,
three-element tuples are generated
containing a prefix, an event name, and a value.
Events will be one of the following:

- ``start_map`` and ``end_map`` indicate
  the beginning and end of a JSON object, respectively.
  They carry a ``None`` as their value.
- ``start_array`` and ``end_array`` indicate
  the beginning and end of a JSON array, respectively.
  They also carry a ``None`` as their value.
- ``map_key`` indicates the name of a field in a JSON object.
  Its associated value is the name itself.
- ``null``, ``boolean``, ``integer``, ``double``, ``number`` and ``string``
  all indicate actual content, which is stored in the associated value.


Prefix
======

A prefix represents the context within a JSON document
where an event originates at.
It works as follows:

- It starts as an empty string.
- A ``<name>`` part is appended when the parser starts parsing the contents
  of a JSON object member called ``name``,
  and removed once the content finishes.
- A literal ``item`` part is appended when the parser is parsing
  elements of a JSON array,
  and removed when the array ends.
- Parts are separated by ``.``.

When using the ``ijson.items`` function,
the prefix works as the selection
for which objects should be automatically built and returned by ijson.


Backends
========

Ijson provides several implementations of the actual parsing in the form of
backends located in ijson/backends:

- ``yajl2_c``: a C extension using `YAJL <http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/>`_ 2.x.
  This is the fastest, but *might* require a compiler and the YAJL development files
  to be present when installing this package.
  Binary wheel distributions exist for major platforms/architectures to spare users
  from having to compile the package.
- ``yajl2_cffi``: wrapper around `YAJL <http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/>`_ 2.x
  using CFFI.
- ``yajl2``: wrapper around YAJL 2.x using ctypes, for when you can't use CFFI
  for some reason.
- ``yajl``: deprecated YAJL 1.x + ctypes wrapper, for even older systems.
- ``python``: pure Python parser, good to use with PyPy

You can import a specific backend and use it in the same way as the top level
library::

    import ijson.backends.yajl2_cffi as ijson

    for item in ijson.items(...):
        # ...

Importing the top level library as ``import ijson``
uses the first available backend in the same order of the list above.


Acknowledgements
================

ijson was originally developed and actively maintained until 2016
by `Ivan Sagalaev <http://softwaremaniacs.org/>`_.
In 2019 he
`handed over <https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson/pull/58#issuecomment-500596815>`_
the maintenance of the project and the PyPI ownership.

Python parser in ijson is relatively simple thanks to `Douglas Crockford
<http://www.crockford.com/>`_ who invented a strict, easy to parse syntax.

The `YAJL <http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/>`_ library by `Lloyd Hilaiel
<http://lloyd.io/>`_ is the most popular and efficient way to parse JSON in an
iterative fashion.

Ijson was inspired by `yajl-py <http://pykler.github.com/yajl-py/>`_ wrapper by
`Hatem Nassrat <http://www.nassrat.ca/>`_. Though ijson borrows almost nothing
from the actual yajl-py code it was used as an example of integration with yajl
using ctypes.
