1.2.1
- Icons updated to better show that this addon is not official.
- Added the disclaimer for that reason.
- Added an entry on the Bugs part of the README stating the problem with version-mixing if installed from this repo and the official one.

1.2.0
- Version bump above the old, unsupported addon, language tag updated to reflect all languages.

1.1.0- Addon now maintained by josecurioso after 2 years without support
- Implemented a new, cleaner way to access Tusubtitulo.com using Beautifulsoup4
- Todo:
    - Code cleanup
    - Implement rating (no actual rating on tusubtitulo.com so I'll figure something)
0.0.6
- Changed host to http://tusubtitulo.com
- Added section 'series' to the main_url
- Fixed an issue that generated the tvshow name with blank spaces at the end when tvshow not listed/indexed in Library, making the normalizer that replaces blanks per dots generate a wrong search string.
- Changed the regex that gets the download links
- Todo:
	- The url endpoint needs a tvshow_id: {tvshow}/{season}/{episode}/{id}... but doesn't process it at all, for now I pass directly a string to comply with the signature.

0.0.5- Addon now maintained by m0r3 due to one year without fixing bugs
     - Updated addon.xml
     - Fixed an issue that prevent the plugin for working if tvshow is not listed properly in library.
Now the plugin will detect this situation and parse filename to get the proper values. Suported formats are: S01e10 110 1x10

0.0.4
- Fixed problem that prevented spanish subtitles to be shown when latino subs were present

0.0.3

- Lang suffix for subtitles is now three words (ESP, ENG, CAT, etc.)
- Better lang handling

0.0.1
- Initial port from Frodo's Subtitulos.es XBMC subtitles plugin by quillo86
