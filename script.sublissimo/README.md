This is a Kodi Addon which can modify your subtitles. It lets you modify or delete specific lines, move all subtitles forward, backward or stretch them out to a given endpoint. Further, you can easily synchronize it with another subtitle, or start up a video file where you can manually choose the exact location of the first and last subtitle which will synchronize the subtitle with the chosen video.
