## About:

This script uses the Kodi Database, via the JSON-RPC server, to find information regarding video and music files and exposes them via Window Properties so that skinners can still cycle through the art by referencing a single point of reference.

__Fun Fact:__ This addon was originally intended as a fix for for Kodi (XBMC) Frodo behavior that was breaking some skins I liked to use. In those days all FanArt was kept in a single directory without the need for caching or texture databases!


## Using This Addon:

This addon is meant to be integrated as part of a skin. Currently it can be configured by calling the RunScript() function within a script. The parameters that can be set are:

* Refresh Time: How long between property updates. Default is 10 seconds
* Mode: Show fanart for recent items (10), or for random items

An example of setting these parameters using the RunScript function would be:
```
RunScript(script.grab.fanart,mode=random,refresh=10).
```
If you want to include these settings are part of the regular skin settings you can pass these as parameters to RunScript upon hitting the home screen or in the Startup.xml file.

### Window Properties:

Currently the service part of this addon will update Home window properties that can be used by skinners. The properties are refreshed according to the "refresh" interval.

### Using In A Skin

To use the ```script.grab.fanart.Ready``` property you could use something like this:

```
!IsEmpty(Window(Home).Property(script.grab.fanart.Ready))
```

To access any of the other properties to load images or display text you can reference the property within your skin files using:
```
$INFO[Window(Home).Property(script.grab.fanart.Video.Title)]
```
