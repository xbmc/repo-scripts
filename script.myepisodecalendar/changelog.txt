1.2.1
+ Optimized the detection of metadata (TV show, season, episode)
+ Only run if detected media type is "tvshow", "season" or "episode" (or unset):
  This prevents the "XY not found" notification when watching movies.
1.2.0
+ Fixed problems with some show titles
+ Verified that the Add-On works as expected with Jarvis
+ Corrected wrong language string when show has been added automatically
+ Improved show search and show title mapping
1.1.1
+ Technical change only: use monitor.abortRequested() and monitor.waitForAbort() instead of xbmx.abortRequested and xbmx.sleep, see http://sourceforge.net/p/xbmc/mailman/message/34581714/
1.1.0
+ Added script.tv.show.next.aired integration:
  Series from MyEpisodeCalendar can now be added to the "TV Show - Next Aired" Add-On's setting "Extra shows". Series removed from MyEpisodeCalendar can also be automatically removed from Next Aired (changing this option requires saving the Add-On settings before taking effect when manually updating)
  Plus, MyEpisodeCalendar can automatically show the "Next Aired" GUI on startup.
  Known issue: MyEpisodeCalendar will now be listed in Programs, despite not doing more than just opening its settings dialogue.
1.0.2
+ Re-check login status and automatic re-login if required when marking an episode as watched.
  (myepisodecalendar.com seems to have a rather short time span for auto-logout)
1.0.1
+ Add German language
+ Some cosmetic changes for settings and notifications
+ New settings tab to disable/enable several notifications (errors will always be shown)

1.0.0 (not released) based on 1.0.15 of script.myepisodes by Maxime Hadjinlian.
