Kodi Oz Weather
===================================

`weather.ozweather`

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bossanova808) 

Script for Kodi for high quality Australian weather data sourced directly from the BOM.  

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. don't install from here - just go to Addons -> Get Addons -> Weather -> OzWeather)

Retrieves BOM data including current conditions, 7-day forecast, and animated radar images.

Script works fine standalone for standard high quality Australian weather data, but you need to make skin changes for the best bit, which is the animated BOM radar support.  See the Kodi [wiki page](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for full details and links to the skin files.

Contributions of skin files for other skins gratefully accepted....just message me on the forums with your skin files (or even better jsut add them directly to the Wiki yourself!).

Support is via the [forum thread](<https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=116905>), or open an issue here.
