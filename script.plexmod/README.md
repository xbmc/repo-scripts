# PlexMod (for Kodi)

This is a modification of the official open-source Plex client for Kodi "plex-for-kodi" (Plex4Kodi)  semi-maintained by me (pannal).

Contrary to how this repository was handled before, this client does _not_ claim to adhere to the Plex Inc. design guidelines, all the time.

It implements features that are not implemented in other official Plex clients and may implement others in non-conform ways.

It is still based off of the original P4K source and critical bugfixes will be PR'd back.

## Active branches
* [develop-kodi21](https://github.com/pannal/plex-for-kodi/tree/develop_kodi21) (Kodi 19, 20, 21 cross-compatible)
* [develop-kodi18](https://github.com/pannal/plex-for-kodi/tree/develop_kodi18) (legacy)

Master branch is based off of the official plex-for-kodi master branch.
