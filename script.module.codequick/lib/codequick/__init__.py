"""
Codequick is a framework for kodi add-onâ€™s. The goal for this framework is to simplify add-on development.
This  is achieved by reducing the amount of boilerplate code to a minimum, while automating as many tasks
that can be automated. Ultimately, allowing the developer to focus primarily on scraping content from
websites and passing it to Kodi.
