Caber Toss for Kodi
===================================

_script.cabertoss_

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bossanova808)

A script to quickly toss your Kodi logs from your Kodi client machine to somewhere more handy, for easier review.

When something unexpected or bad happens, just run this add-on to copy the latest Kodi logs to your chosen destination.

Even better, bind this to a remote button (use `Runscript(script.cabertoss)`) so you can carry on with your relaxing and deal with the issue later (without having to wade through all the stuff you did after the issue happened!).
