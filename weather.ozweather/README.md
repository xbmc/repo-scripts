Kodi Oz Weather
===================================

`weather.ozweather`

Script for Kodi for Australian weather.  

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. don't install from here - just go to Addons -> Get Addons -> Weather -> OzWeather)

Retrieves BOM dat including current conditions, 7-day forecast, and radar images.

Script works fine standalone for standard high quality Australian weather data, but you need to make skin changes for the best bit, which is the animated BOM radar support.  

Support is via the [forum thread](<https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=116905>), 

See the Kodi [wiki page](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for full details and links to the skin files.

Contributions of skin files for other skins gratefully accepted....just message me on the forums with your skin files (or even better jsut add them directly to the Wiki yourself!).
