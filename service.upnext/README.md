# Up Next - Proposes to play the next episode automatically

This Kodi add-on shows a Netflix-style notification for watching the next episode. After a few automatic iterations it asks the user if he is still there watching.

A lot of existing add-ons already integrate with this service out-of-the-box.

## Settings
The add-on has various settings to fine-tune the experience, however the default settings should be fine for most.

  * Simple or fancy mode (defaults to fancy mode, but a more simple interface is possible)
  * The notification time can be adjusted (defaults to 30 seconds before the end)
  * The default action can be confnigured, i.e. should it advance to the next episode (default) when the user does not respond, or stop
  * The number of episodes to play automatically before asking the user if he is still there (defaults to 3 episodes)

> NOTE: The add-on settings are found in the Kodi add-ons section, in the *Services* category.
