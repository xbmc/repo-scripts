  (upadrian)
- More robust final download link RE-based extraction.
- Handle .srt filenames with unicode chars more robustly.
- Make rating actually helpful by reflecting relative download count.
- Cleanup uploader comment for the subtitle.

0.0.8
- Handle new page added by subdivx.com. Thanks github users @upadrian,
  @gboado and @felexx90
- Simplify handling of temporary directory used to download & uncompress
  subtitle files by skipping the 'remove it recursively and re-create' stage
  which caused problems with mixed/unknown encodings, Unicode text passed in
  by Kodi or read from the FS when calling shutil.rmtree().
  Instead, use Python's tempfile.mkdtemp() and don't remove tempdirs.
- Toggle default value of setting 'Show uploader name in place of language'
  added in v0.0.5 to be ON.

0.0.7
- Remove code added for 0.0.5 which isn't needed, had been added to workarond
  a Kodi Helix bug with handling of temp dir.
- Implement manual search. Issue #2. Thanks Diego Garber.
- Minor cleanups

0.0.6
- When the new option to show nicks was set, the subtitle file written ended
  in '..srt' instead of '.es.srt'. Workaround this with a hack.
- Remove flag column from search results table.
- More code readability/maintainability work.
- Copied workaround for xbmcvfs.exists() problem in Kodi 14 (Helix) from
  opensubtitles add-on, thanks to its authors.

0.0.5
- Add first setting: Show uploader name in place of language
  Being a spanish subtitles site, there is no point in showing the spanish
  flag and literal in the first column so we put that spot of the screen to
  better use: There are some renowned uploaders in the Subdivx.community and,
  for lack of more structured information in Subdivx, it can be a very
  important piece of information when it comes to choosing from several
  subtitles. Show his/her nick there.
  Initially the value of the setting is False. We'll see if it's worth
  changing it to True in some future release.
- Bullet-proof .rar uncompression as it's a popular file format on subdivx.com

0.0.4
- More robust parsing of description, better logging.
- Also match variation in CSS class name just in case.
- Fix stripping of trailing '/' from param value.

0.0.3
- Handle arbitrary casing in subs file extension, e.g. .SRT, .sRt, etc.
- More code cleanup (PEP8, comment/docstring typos, logic of a helper function).

0.0.2
- Fixed accented characters mojibake.
- Removed or replaced code of dubious utility/robustness.
- More idiomatic Python code.

0.0.1
- Initial port to new Gotham structure.
