Kodi Unpause Jumpback
===================================

_script.xbmc.unpausejumpback_

Simple Kodi Service to jump back a configurable number of seconds after pause, or rewind/fast-forward events.

By default the actual jump back happens on **resumption** of playback.  

For low power systems, you can set the jump back to happen during the pause period, for a smoother experience.

PVR/HTTP(s) and 3 paths can be marked as exclusions.

Originally by Memphiz, taken over July 2020 by bossanova808 for Kodi Matrix and beyond.

Available in the official Kodi repository (legacy Python 2 version for Kodi Leia and below, Python 3 version for Kodi Matrix and on).
