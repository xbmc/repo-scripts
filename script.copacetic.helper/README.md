### Credit
---
* __sualfred__ for [script.embuary.helper](https://github.com/sualfred/script.embuary.helper), which served as the basis for this addon. The script and service sections are completely rewritten/modified, but some of the code and structure of the plugin section remains a very simplified version of Sualfred's work.

### Special thanks
---
* __jurialmunkey__ for all the best-practice code examples from [plugin.video.themoviedb.helper](https://github.com/jurialmunkey/plugin.video.themoviedb.helper) and forum support.
