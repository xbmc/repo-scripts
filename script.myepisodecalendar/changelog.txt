1.3.0
+ prevent some unhandled exceptions
+ cleaned up the code a bit
+ removed script.tv.show.next.aired integration (it is not desired by the Kodi team for addons to change other addons' settings)

  This prevents the "XY not found" notification when watching movies.

+ Improved show search and show title mapping

1.1.0
+ Added script.tv.show.next.aired integration:
  Series from MyEpisodeCalendar can now be added to the "TV Show - Next Aired" Add-On's setting "Extra shows". Series removed from MyEpisodeCalendar can also be automatically removed from Next Aired (changing this option requires saving the Add-On settings before taking effect when manually updating)
  Plus, MyEpisodeCalendar can automatically show the "Next Aired" GUI on startup.
  Known issue: MyEpisodeCalendar will now be listed in Programs, despite not doing more than just opening its settings dialogue.
1.0.2
+ Re-check login status and automatic re-login if required when marking an episode as watched.
  (myepisodecalendar.com seems to have a rather short time span for auto-logout)
